Tracks 2.7.0 will be the last release to support Ruby 3.0.
It also contains numerous dependency upgrades including security upgrades and
fixes some documentation and localisation bugs.

Ruby versions below 3.0 are not supported. This release of Tracks is tested
on Ruby versions 3.0, 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. The base version for the Docker image
was updated from Ruby 2.7 to Ruby 3.3.

### Removed features

* Support for Ruby 2.6 and 2.7 were dropped.
* Support for inbound message handling was dropped due to API changes caused by required Ruby on Rails upgrade. If you need this, comment in the [issue](https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/issues/2463).
* Rubocop is no longer used in the CI due to missing support for Ruby > 2.5.

### Deprecations

* This will be the last release to support Ruby 3.0, which is already end-of-life.

### Bug fixes

* Lots of dependencies have been updated (including security updates).

### Updated translations

* Spanish (thanks Gallegonovato!)
* Dutch (thanks Ranforingus!)
* Russian (thanks Alexey Svistunov!)
* Turkish (thanks Burak HÃ¼seyin Ekseli!)
