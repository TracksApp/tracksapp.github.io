Version: 1.01

*Note: this version isn't compatible with Rails 0.10.0. If you're using this version of Rails, you need to make a small change in one file as a temporary fix, as described "here":http://rousette.org.uk/projects/news/17/fix-for-running-tracks-101-under-rails-0100*

I've made a very minor update to Tracks to fix some of the re-directing bugs, and to update the application properly for Rails 0.9.3. There are also some minor updates to the layout of the items so that the buttons for edit, delete and notes are always below the description and somewhat to the right of the checkbox. I think this improves usability a bit, because the buttons are always in the same place relative to the item, but let me know what you think.

Note that you *do* need to have Rails 0.9.3 installed for this version, but the upside is that you won't have to manually tinker with the files in config/* to get it to work properly.

I've also added Subversion access if anyone is interested--read about it "here":http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/article/11/subversion-access-available, and let me know if you want write as well as read access so that you can contribute.
