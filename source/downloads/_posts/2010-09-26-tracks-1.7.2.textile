Version: 1.7.2

"Git URL":https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/tree/v1.7.2

I'm pleased to announce that Tracks 1.7.2 has been released. This is a bug fix release. This will hopefully be the last release for 1.7. We are working towards the release of Tracks 2.0 which will include new functionality.

You can download this new stable version of Tracks directly from Github and a manual can be found also on Github as well as on the Tracks website.

Fixes in this release

* you can now set dates after 31-12-2010 with the date picker
* better warning that if you delete a context, all (repeating) todos in it are deleted too
