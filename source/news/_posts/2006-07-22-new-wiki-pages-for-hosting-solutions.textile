I've started a couple of pages on the wiki for "recommended web hosts":http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/wiki/Recommended-Web-Hosts/ for Tracks (i.e. web hosts that enable you to install Tracks yourself on a public server), and also "hosted Tracks installations":http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/wiki/Tracks-Hosting/, where all you have to do is sign up for an account.

If you have any links to add to either page, please do. You need to sign in using the same credentials as you use for the "Tracks Forum":http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/forums/. If you don't want to sign up for the forum, just send me the details that you want added and I'll do it.
