You might have noticed that I have changed the affiliate box at the top left of these pages, as well as adding some affiliate links elsewhere. The Joyent affiliate programme appears to have ended, and when an opportunity came up to join the "JumpBox":http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?u=188858&b=179734&m=22742&afftrack=&urllink=www%2Ejumpbox%2Ecom affiliate program, I jumped (no pun intended) at the chance. I've also updated the links to JumpBox elsewhere on the site and on the manual, so if you are thinking of signing up for a JumpBox plan, please use the affiliate links and you will be helping to support the Tracks development programme.
