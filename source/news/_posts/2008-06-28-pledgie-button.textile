GitHub provides a handy shortcut for creating a "Pledgie":http://pledgie.org/ campaign, and shows the button on the repository page. We were previously accepting donations using a Paypal button, which meant I then had to do some mental arithmetic and manually update the MacBook-O-Meter to show the additional donations. Pledgie is much easier to use, so I've now embedded the Pledgie button on the "Contribute":http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/tracks/contribute page, and also in the sidebar of the site. Click the button if you feel like making a donation! Pledgie donations can be anonymous or you can display your name proudly in the donors list, and you can use PayPal or a credit card for payment.
