After a lot of soul-searching, I've set up a PayPal donate button for those of you who would like to make a donation to support Tracks. We have a goal in mind: buying a MacBook for each of the developers, so that we can properly test Tracks on the Mac, Windows <em>and</em> Linux, using Parallels Desktop. See the "Contribute":http://www.rousette.org.uk/projects/tracks/contribute page for the full details, and thanks in advance to anyone who is kind enough to make a donation!
