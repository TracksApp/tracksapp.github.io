Those of you who do not regularly read the forum may be unaware that Tracks 2.0 Release Candidate 2 has now been prepared by Reinier Balt. You can read all the "details":http://www.getontracks.org/forums/viewthread/839/ on the forum, or just head straight over to Github to download the 2.0RC2 branch "here":https://github.com/bsag/tracks/zipball/v2.0RC2.

We need your help in testing it out, so please give it a try and let us know of any bugs or problems on "this forum thread":http://www.getontracks.org/forums/viewthread/839/. Many thanks!
