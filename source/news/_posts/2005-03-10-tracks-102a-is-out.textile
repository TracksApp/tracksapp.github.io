I've just posted Tracks 1.02a "here":http://rousette.org.uk/projects/downloads/18/tracks-102a. I was hoping to add a few more features before 1.02a, but there's still quite a lot of new stuff, and I wanted people to be able to take advantage of Rails 0.10.0. So this version of Rails is a *requirement* for Tracks 1.02a, and it will hopefully solve the problems people had when trying to downgrade to a compatible Rails version with Tracks 1.01.

Have fun, and as usual, let me know if I've broken anything. In case you're wondering (and I can tell that you are...) the 'a' suffix is due to the fact that I messed up the first tagged version in svn, and couldn't figure out how to delete a tag <img src="http://www.getontracks.org/images/smileys/wink.gif" width="19" height="19" alt="wink" style="border:0;" />.
