Tracks 2.7.1 can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/archive/v2.7.1.zip).

This release fixes a few reflected XSS vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-41805) which enabled execution
of malicious JavaScript in the context of a userâ€™s browser if that user clicks
on a malicious link, possibly allowing retrieval or modification of the current
user's data. The issue is of moderate severity (score 6.1/10) with the CVSS
rating CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N.

Upgrade instructions can be found [in the manual](https://github.com/TracksApp/tracks/blob/v2.7.1/doc/upgrading.md).
